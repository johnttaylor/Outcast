Publishes the Primary Package
===============================================================================
usage: orc [common-opts] publish [options] <semver> <comments>
       orc [common-opts] publish [options] help
       orc [common-opts] publish [options] 

Arguments:
    <semver>        The Semantic version information for the Published version
    <comments>      Publish comments
    help            Display the recommended steps/process for publishing a
                    package

Options:
    --edit          Updates the 'current' publish information in place, i.e.
                    does not create a new version.  The date/time fields are
                    NOT updated.
    --edithist N    Updates the 'N' entry in the History array.  N is zero
                    based index. The date/time fields are NOT updated.
    -w              Suppress warning about missing files
    --nodirs        Skip updating the pkg-dirs.lst when publishing
    -h, --help      Display help for this command

Common Options:
    See 'orc --help'
    
    
Notes:
    o Publishing simply associates a comment/date/semantic-version with
      package at a point in time (i.e. only the package.json file is updated).
    o The user is responsible for archiving/labeling/tagging the package
      in its native SCM environment.
    o Publishing is not require for package management. However, life is
      better with respect to managing dependencies if packages are published.

""" The following are the recommend steps for publishing an Outcast2 package:

  1  The source-code/changes are completed and ready to submit a pull request.

 [2] Use the 'orc info' command to set the package's basic information.  
     NOTE: this step only needs to be performed ONCE during the life of the 
     package (or on change of the package's information).

 [3] If the package is intended to be adopted as an 'overlay' package, use 
     the 'orc dirs set' command to set the package's primary directories. 
     NOTE: this step only needs to be performed ONCE during the life of the 
     package (or on change of the package's primary directories ).

 [4] If the package is intended to be adopted as an 'overlay' package, use 
     the 'orc dirs xset' command to set the package's 'adopted-extra' dirs. 
     NOTE: this step only needs to be performed ONCE during the life of the 
     package (or on change of the package's adopted-extra directories ).

 [5] If the package is intended to be adopted as an 'overlay' package, edit
     (or create) the package's 'ignore-dirs.lst' file.  Populate the file as
     needed.
     NOTE: this step only needs to be performed ONCE during the life of the 
     package (or on change of the package's ignore directories ).

  6  Run the 'orc publish' command to specify the semantic version information
     and brief description of what is being published.

  7  Commit and push changes to the package's Outcast files.

  8  Create the pull request for publishing the source-code/changes.

  9  Complete the pull request process and merge the PR into its parent
     branch.

[10] If the parent branch is not a 'release' branch, then propagate  the merged
     changes to the 'release' branch

 11  Create a Tag/label - with the same semantic version information from 
     step 6 - and apply the tag/label to the 'release' branch from step 
     9 (or 10).
     Note: If using 'git' make sure that the tag gets pushed back to the 
           package's origin (e.g. git push origin MY-TAG-Maj.Min.Patch)
