# Outcast 

Outcast is a tool suite (well proof of concept really) for managing source code packages for reuse by
other packages.  The Outcast concept is the result of trying to solve the problem of how to manage, in a team environment, 
a scalable reusable code base.  See www.integerfox.com/outcast for more details
